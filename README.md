# Hi thereðŸ‘‹, It's Syed.
As a Software Developer with a keen focus on backend development, I bring a wealth of professional experience in API development utilizing Node.js and Express.js, following the latest best practices and industry trends. My technical skills spans a diverse range of programming languages, including C++, Java, Python, Golang, and JavaScript, allowing me to adapt and contribute across different aspects of software development effectively.

With solid foundation in back-end technologies, My expertise extends to data modelling in SQL and NoSQL databases, including Neo4j, MongoDB, and MySQL.

Cloud computing is another area of my expertise, having fundamental knowledge in both Azure and AWS. However, my specialization lies in Azure, for which I have obtained the Azure Fundamentals Certification. This knowledge enables me to leverage cloud services and solutions.

Beyond my technical skills, I am recognized for my strong soft skills, including effective communication, teamwork, time management, and leadership. My proactive participation in projects has not only honed my technical skills but also my problem-solving, critical thinking, and collaborative abilities.

I am on a path towards becoming a Software Architect, actively expanding my understanding of DevOps practices, including CI/CD pipelines and containerization with Docker and Kubernetes. This journey reflects my commitment to continuous learning and my ambition to contribute to the creation of innovative, efficient, and secure software solutions.

Let's connect! I am always open to discussing new technologies, project collaborations, or sharing insights on the evolving landscape of software development.
